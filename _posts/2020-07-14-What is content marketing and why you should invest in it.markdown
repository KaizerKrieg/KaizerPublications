Content marketing is using content in order to market your business. 

Let’s break it down.

<h2>What is content?</h2> 

Content is anything that sends a message. From articles to podcasts, content is anything that makes you think or feel. It is a shared idea or experience. 

Blogposts, videos, podcasts, magazines, images; anything goes. What matters is the ability to connect. If you see something that you like, that’s content. 

<h2>Content and you</h2>

Everybody wants your attention but you just want to watch your cat video. Or catch up with a friend. And you would, if it wasn’t for these damnable ads!

AdBlock is a god-send. No more pop-ups, no more intrusive ads. Just you and your cat video, the way it was always meant to be. 

Unless you’re a marketer that is.

Even with trackers and optimized ads. Even with fancy analytics and smart sounding acronyms, your Facebook ad just doesn’t generate sales. Even though you're still paying for them. Queue some whiskey blues.


However, no amount of expletives will solve your issue. You see, the problem is the cat video. Yes, If it wasn’t for that cat video, just imagine what you could do with all those views! 

<h2>Perspective is everything</h2>

If we look closely at what content is, it becomes clear that without content, you cannot have an effective marketing campaign.

If you have a product, you need to explain why I should buy it. Further, you need to prove that what you’re saying is true. What’s more, I have to understand you and resonate with your message.

Classic example; How do you buy fresh produce? For most of us, you have to physically go to the store and choose the particular fruit or vegetable you wish to buy. Why does this matter? The customer’s thought process. 
1. They know what they need and its value
    
2. They know where to get it
    
3. They know how to choose what they want from competing products 

We all know this. So, why do we insist on intrusive ads? Assumptions. You assume that your customer has gone through the above process and they are just now choosing a product. Even if your ad is tailored to increase awareness, that doesn’t mean it will increase sales unless you can convince customers to make a purchase. 

That’s why it doesn’t work. 

From a business’ perspective, you have a million other competitors and the customer can’t tell the difference. If your solution is to increase visibility through online ads, you’re not completely wrong. Only, you’re just as visible as everybody else who uses online ads. You need to differentiate yourself in an attractive way. 

<h2>What does this mean for your business?</h2>

It means that your marketing cannot be focused only on letting people know about your product. They have to understand why it’s the best suited for them. The best way to do that is through connecting with your customers. 

Its through making your customers know that you understand them by showing to them that your product can meet their needs. 

If you have a product and you’re promoting it, why should you let others decide what to say about it? 

At its most basic level, content marketing is sharing experiences or ideas. It’s about connecting. It’s about communication. Why should I buy your product and can you prove your claims? 
 
Content marketing is the most effective way to control the narrative.
               
<h2>Why should you invest in content marketing?</h2>

Content marketing is more than just telling people about your product. It’s about connecting with other people through a product you love and you know can help them. 

The customer just doesn’t know it yet. 

You have to show them. Connect with them. Make them understand why they need your product. 

There are four main reasons why;

1. It establishes you as a resource.
This builds trust with your customer. They can go to you for any concerns they may have and this builds your brand. A stronger brand is more valuable to both customers and investors.

2. It attracts customers who know they need you
People who are actively looking for a solution to their problem will come across your content and if they like it, you’ve got a potential customer. 

3. It creates strong brand awareness
Your brand will grow because people can trust you and you are attracting people who are interested in your product. This creates a flywheel effect for your business. Over time, you will attract more and more customers who already love what you have to offer.

4. It tells your story
People love stories. They want to connect. By telling your story you attract like minds. These people might be interested in what you have to offer because they resonate with your message. 

Content marketing is all about connection. It allows you the opportunity to capture the hearts and minds of like-minded people. 
These connections are extremely valuable for your business. These are people that love what you do. They are ready to buy your products because they feel understood. What’s more, the product delivers because it was targeted specifically to them. 

Content marketing is one of the most effective forms of marketing.
