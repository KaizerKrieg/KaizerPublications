A content marketing strategy is your go-to guide for your content marketing goals. 

Your goals are defined internally. This is the impact you want to have. Whether it is reaching a certain sales goal or creating an amazing customer experience or both. It is ultimately the aim of your business. 

You should also determine how you will go about achieving them. This includes the media you  want to use and the branding. What is the kind of atmosphere and/or culture you want to cultivate? What values do you want to promote? What is completely unacceptable? 

Having a clear vision of the kind of business you want to develop will determine your content marketing strategy. 

<h2>What is a content marketing strategy?</h2>

A content marketing strategy is simply what you want to say and how you’re going to say it. 

What you want to say is defined by your desired impact. How you’re going to say it is defined by your content marketing strategy.

There are many ways to get your message across; both online and offline. 

Online content marketing, however, is extremely versatile. So long as you’re telling a story, that’s content marketing. By taking advantage of the different forms of media, you can tell your story in a fresh, unique and relatable way. 

Content marketing is not limited to articles. It is expansive. From video to podcasts to games; content marketing thrives off creativity.
A brand can engage customers through social media posts and interact with them in the same vein. Naturally, people who love what they see or feel good about your brand can share it. Those people are evangelists and they grow businesses. 

What you’re looking for is connection. Think about it this way. You love your business and you know it can improve people’s lives. You want to attract people who love what you’re doing. Why not just show it to them when they’re looking for it? That is a content marketing strategy. 

<h2>How do you develop a content marketing strategy?</h2>

1. Determine your goals
This is the first step. It sets the stage for everything else. Your vision should be as comprehensive as possible in order to avoid painful setbacks in the future. Your goals determine your brand and tone, how you interact with your customers and how you’re going to approach them. 

2. Define your audience
Determine who your target customer is. Demographics, tendencies, influences and pain points. You want a clear image as possible in order to understand them as much as you can. This determines your preferred mode of engagement. 
Children are not going to read white papers but an executive might. However, he doesn’t have time for YouTube in-between power lunches. A teenager just might. Find out what your preferred audience likes and use that to your advantage.

3. Content
Determine what kind of content is most effective for you and why. Revisit previous content and measure its effectiveness. Create A/B tests to determine effectiveness of your current content. Develop content that suits your brand’s tone, voice and style. Adapt it to your audience’s interests and habits. 
A rich guy needs fancy looking images but a broke college student will DIY his way to the top if he can find that one YouTube video. A podcast might be perfect for your feature section. However, an article will work much better for a tutorial on how to mix your product that consists of thirteen different chemicals whose effects are all vastly different.

4. Metrics
Measure the effectiveness of your content. Traffic, engagement, shares and conversions. Get to know how people are engaging with your content and adapt as necessary.
Perhaps that hilarious cat video isn’t getting any shares? Why? Metrics can help uncover customer behavior. Maybe they like your videos but not your articles? They can effectively map out where your business’ various strengths and weaknesses lie.  

<h2>Pro tips:</h2> 
With your content marketing strategy in place, you need to get on track and see how it matches with your goals. Define smaller goals that would measure your progress and ensure you’re on track to meeting your vision. 

Develop a content around your brand as well. Develop content that strengthens your brand. It should match your tone, voice and style. Think expensive looking images for Rolex but ludicrous ones for Cracked. 

The content should also be relevant and accessible to your audience as well. Target the right kind of reader and you should see results. They want your product and you need to position yourself as the solution. 

Content marketing takes time. However, it can be less expensive and much more profitable. If I love interacting with your brand, even if it’s just sharing your tweets, who am I going to turn to when I want to buy a similar product?
