In order to understand content mapping, we need to understand the marketing funnel.

The marketing funnel is a representation of how people behave as they interact with your product. It is described as a funnel because more people learn about your brand than the ones who actually buy from you. 

The goal with developing a strong marketing funnel is to interact with, convert and retain as many customers as possible.

<h2>Levels of the Marketing Funnel</h2>

1. Finding out about your brand
At this stage, the person has only just found out about your brand. They do not know your products, like them or even trust them. Your business is completely unknown to them and they are deciding whether they want to find out more. They will only accept low risk offers. These offers require little to no investment of time, money or energy. 
Most customers at this stage are not even sure they need the product. Life was going on just great wasn’t it? This product though...

2. Liking your brand
The person has found out more about your brand and they like what they see. They may even share their interest about you with other people. They can engage with your business at a deeper level now. They are willing to attempt a higher risk offer. They are also comparing your brand to your competitors.
It’s like going out on a second date. You like them enough to want to see them a second time but they could still be an ax murderer. Albeit a dedicated one. 
Customers need to know that they can trust you. They are willing to test the waters out. An offer to whet their appetite would not be remiss. So long as they do not have that much to lose, they just might buy you lunch. 

3. Trust and conversion
At this stage they either become a customer or abandon the whole prospect entirely. They’re past considering your credibility. They just need to know whether the product is right for them. You need to convince them to buy. 
This is the third date. If it doesn’t happen now, then it probably never will. Another missed connection to add to the long list of could-haves and should-haves. 
At this point, the business has nothing to lose by going in strong. You’re already invested but the customer’s playing coy. They know they want you but they don’t want to commit. Double-down on your offer. Go in for the kill. She might just swoon and you need to be there to pick her up. 

4. Retention
At this stage, your business’ focus should be at maintaining your customers. You should affirm their faith in you. Provide an amazing after-purchase experience. They will in turn become evangelists of your product.
You’ve won. You’ve just got to do a little maintenance. Remind them why you’re the best. Show them that you care. Send them flowers. They’ll appreciate it. They’ll continue to buy your product and tell others about it. If and only if, they feel like a valued customer.

<h2>Content Mapping and the Marketing Funnel</h2>

What does this have to do with content mapping?

Content mapping is developing content that is designed to guide the buyer through this process. It is targeted to every stage the customer goes through and aimed towards guiding them to the next stage. 

The exact content will depend on your content marketing strategy. Maybe your brand focuses on video content in order to engage people who love YouTube. You can create a video series that reflect your customer’s thought process. A guide for newbies, tutorials for adepts and showcase montages for experts. 

 Different forms of content will be useful at different stages. An in-depth article might be more useful to newbies but an email newsletter might close sales. The key is in combining both concepts; content mapping and the marketing funnel. The rest is creativity. 

That is the beauty of content marketing. It is highly versatile and can generate massive traffic while staying unique and true to the brand. 

Content mapping is content marketing taken to the next level. It is adapted to suit the customer and can grow businesses exponentially.
