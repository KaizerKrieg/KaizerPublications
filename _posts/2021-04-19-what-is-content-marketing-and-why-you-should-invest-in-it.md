# What is Content Marketing?


Content marketing is using content in order to market your business. 


It is an inbound marketing strategy that focuses on creating unique experiences for your customer. These experiences are in the form of content.


Let’s break it down.


## What is Content?


Content is anything that sends a message. It is a shared idea or experience. 


Blog posts, videos, podcasts, magazines, images; anything goes. What matters is the ability to connect. If you see something that you like, that’s content.


## Perspective is Everything


Content marketing is effective because it connects with your customers. It resonates with them. It makes them feel understood and appreciated.


This is important. Least of all because people often make emotional purchases. The main reason this is important is that it communicates who you are to your potential customers. If they decide to purchase from you then it is because there is a genuine connection.


The closer we look at content and the role it plays in your marketing campaign, the clearer it becomes that content marketing is pivotal to your success.


Effective marketing is essential to any business. You need to get your name and your product out there. The question is, how will you become and remain relevant to your potential customers?


Traditionally, over-the-top intrusive ads were the way to go. However, everybody hates them. Very few of these ads are remembered with fondness. Most of them are just a blight on prime-time entertainment and the environment. Despite the fact that advertisements run the media industry, everybody still hates intrusive ads.


This is why content marketing can be so powerful. It turns the entire equation on its head. Instead of sponsoring a reality TV show, why not make your own centered around your product? 


Daunting? Definitely. Doable? Already done. Xzibit did it with “Pimp my Ride.”


## Logically Speaking…

Classic example; How do you buy fresh produce? For most of us, you have to physically go to the store and choose the particular fruit or vegetable you wish to buy. As you’re doing this, what goes on through your mind?
    
1. What do I need? How much? 
2. Is this the best deal? 
3. Are there alternatives?

So on and so forth. The point is, as we go about making such decisions, we need to find the right information to guide us. This is where content marketing comes in.

YOUR business can be the resource. YOUR business can be the guide. YOUR business can be the standard. 

If all else fails, your business can tell your story and connect you with people who resonate with you. 


## What Does This Mean for Your Business?

I get it. You’re not running a charity and a publication business just to make friends. Why bother when it takes the same amount of time to scrape together a Facebook ad as it does to write a paragraph? Same difference right? Wrong.


Content marketing isn’t just about getting your name out there. You’re not trying to reach as many eyeballs as possible while hoping and praying that your headline works. 


Content marketing is a strategic approach designed to connect you with the customer through a shared experience. It’s being in bed together while joking about who has worse farts. Who smelt it dealt it sure but you’re both in it now.


The fact is that your business is not centered around you and your shiny new product. That’s not enough. It’s about solving problems for other people. And the only way to connect with real people is to be authentic.


This means that your marketing campaign cannot be focused only on letting people know about your product. They have to understand why it’s the best suited for them and why they should buy from you and not your competitors.


If you want to cut through the noise, then you have to say something worth hearing. That’s how you garner attention. And once you do that, you can build an audience that already loves and supports your products. Win win.


Also, if you have a product and you’re marketing it, why should you let others decide what to say about it? You created it, why should someone else tell your product’s story or your company’s story for that matter? 
 

Content marketing is the most effective way to control the narrative.


## A Note on Intrusive Ads


Are intrusive ads useless? No. Are they effective? Potentially. Should they be your only, or your primary for of marketing? No.


One of the biggest factors against intrusive ads is their history. Almost everyone has clicked on one, only to be disappointed. False promises, poor products and terrible leads. Nobody likes that experience. It’s like you’re being hustled. And more often than not, you are.


So, why do we insist on intrusive ads? Assumptions.


You assume that your customer has done all his research and he knows what he wants. You assume he knows that you are better than your competitors. You assume he knows the difference between the shiny shoes and the not-so shiny shoes.


Another factor to consider is that even if your ad is tailored to increase awareness, that doesn’t mean it will increase sales unless you can convince customers to make a purchase.


These are just some of the reasons why intrusive ads don’t work as well as people imagine they should.


From a business’ perspective, you have a million other competitors and the customer can’t tell the difference. If your solution is to increase visibility through online ads, you’re not completely wrong. 


Only, you’re just as visible as everybody else who uses online ads. You need to differentiate yourself in an attractive way.


## SEO: Writing for Robots or People?


I can hear it already. The whole point of advertising is getting your name out there. How exactly does my blog in this far corner of the internet make that possible?


Intrusive ads do this effortlessly. They can be targeted. It’s part of the package. Where’s the marketing in content marketing?


Modern problems require modern solutions. The same advantages so generously enjoyed by intrusive ads can be had for a fraction of the price. Trackers exit stage left and SEO enters stage right.


Even the most basic SEO coupled with great content will attract people to you. Search engines are designed to give their users the content they are looking for. That is the sole reason they exist. If they cannot give you the content you want then why would you use it?


Do you see the opportunity? Create the content people want and they will find you. It’s only natural.


Think of it like a woman set on seducing a man. What’s her greatest asset? A man’s imagination.


## Why Should You Invest in Content Marketing?


Content marketing is more than just telling people about your product. It’s about connecting with other people through a product you love and you know can help them.


The customer just doesn’t know it yet.


Think about it. How many times have you seen something cool on YouTube and decided you just have to get it? That is content marketing at its finest.


You can try to convince me all day long that I don’t need a liter bike. But have you seen [R1 Riley’s videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdkoXaFmp2o)? He doesn’t even sell R1’s but I’d buy one just off the feeling I got from watching his videos. Even though I’m a Busaboi for life!


One thing to note is that there is a subtle difference between copy writing and content marketing. Copy writing is a push strategy, while content marketing is a pull strategy.


The difference is subtle but can have monumental effects. There is a difference between ranting and raving about something cool and just doing it.


Imagine if you went to the best cinema in town. They had the best seats, awesome popcorn and a chaperone to boot. But when it came to screening, they just showed a teaser trailer and then review after review. You didn’t even get to see the damn movie.


Imagine instead if you went to another cinema where the first movie was free. And then all they did was give you the best experience. Yeah, the chaperone was overworked and those seats had seen better days but the movie was absolutely perfect. Would you go back?


Whether or not you can run a profitable cinema this way remains to be seen. Nonetheless, if you can provide an experience that the customer will never forget, you might just see an increase in sales.


People buy Gucci clothing for three times the price of normal clothing just because its Gucci. It’s dumb. It’s human. People have hearts and you are selling to people, not robots capable of performing rational cost-benefit analyses.


The point is not to manipulate. It is to connect. If you feel like a hunk just because you bought an overpriced pair of jeans then I’m happy for you. If you’re the business owner, how are you going to sell last year’s leftover stock without getting other customers just as emotionally invested?


We all have hearts whose rhythms we dance to. The question is are you going to sell-out or cash in on who you are? Of course, those who can’t hear the rhythm will think you’re insane.


Nietzsche said that. What about you? What’s your story?


## To Recapitulate


Content Marketing is using content to market your business.


Content is a shared idea or experience.


Content marketing is effective because it connects you with people who resonate with your message.


This is great for your business because;

* It establishes you as a resource

The content you create should be informative. This builds trust with your customer. They can go to you for any concerns they may have and this builds your brand. A strong brand is valuable to both customers and investors.


* It attracts customers who know they need you

By coupling SEO with great content, Google becomes your greatest asset. People who are actively looking for a solution to their problem will come across your content and if they like it, you’ve got a potential customer.


* It creates strong brand awareness

Your brand will grow because people can trust you. Your content by itself meets some of their needs. Further, you are attracting people who are interested in your product. This creates a flywheel effect for your business. Over time, you will attract more and more customers who already love what you have to offer.


* It tells your story

People love stories. They want to connect. By telling your story you attract like minds. These people might be interested in what you have to offer because they resonate with your message.


* Dirt cheap

You might not be able to shoot feature films or [send astronauts to space like RedBull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHtvDA0W34I). However, if that was the only way to connect with people then we’d all be action movie stars in space with caffeine addictions. Yet, RedBull’s example highlights something important. All you really need is a bit of creativity. 


People are actively looking for ways to connect. Your job is to find that way. We don’t need feature films, we need people to share them with. As an added bonus, depending on how you publish, you could end up with another asset in the form of a publishing platform that you control.


Content marketing is all about connection. It allows you the opportunity to capture the hearts and minds of like-minded people.


These connections are extremely valuable for your business. These are people that love what you do. They are ready to buy your products because they feel understood. What’s more, the product delivers because it was targeted specifically to them.


Content marketing is one of the most effective forms of marketing.
