Content Marketing is effective. But only when done properly.


Here’s the catch: You’re probably a great guy and maybe your crackpot idea can help me out. Why don’t you make my job easier and just show me that?


This is some real meat and bones stuff right here.

## What is a Content Marketing Strategy?

A content marketing strategy is simply what you want to say and how you’re going to say it.

What you want to say depends on your desired impact. How you’re going to say it is determined by your content marketing strategy.

According to “Content Inc” by Joe Pulizzi, here are a few aspects to consider:


#### I. The Sweet Spot


This is your unique blend of passion and skills or knowledge. This is the bedrock of all the content you produce.


Content is a shared idea or experience designed to market your business. It is who you are and what your business stands for. Your mission isn’t a fancy manifesto that you hang on your wall. Your content should be all about what you stand for and your business should follow through.


If your business values transparency, then why not develop an in-depth guide as relates to your industry? If you want to promote children’s rights, instead of funding a random charity, why not sponsor in-house events where you and your customers get together and do something special for these children?


This is why defining what is important to you is crucial. Otherwise your message will get lost in the noise.


The message here is simple. Don’t just talk about it. Do it.


#### II. Content Tilt


This is your USP(unique selling proposition). What stands out about your content? Why should we care? The internet is filled with copycats. You do not want to be one of them.


Another reason to be original is that your story is unique to you. Why would you trade that for someone else’s? Truth is stranger than fiction. Envy is ignorance and imitation is suicide.


Remember to also follow through. Anybody can dream but how many people live to see their dreams come true? Is that your story?


#### III. Building the Base


What kind of content will you publish? Where will you publish your content? Your content needs to be amazing for sure, but it also needs a proper platform.


Amazing content is not complicated. Joe advises that you should focus on: solving a problem, being consistent, being human, having an independent perspective, avoiding sales speak and being the best in your space.


In a nutshell; focus your content on being the best version of yourself, constant improvement and helping out as much as you can.


In order to choose the best platform for your content focus on reach and control. Reach is simply a measure of how many people you can get to. Control is all about power. Who controls your channel?


Facebook may have excellent reach but you have no control over the platform. What if they change their rules and suddenly your content is sidelined? Your blog may have little to no reach but you have all the power. All you have to do is direct people to it.


Mix social media and self-publishing for maximum results.


Finally, create a content calendar and stick to it religiously. Additionally, you can also create a team that will support your content creation goals.


#### IV. Harvesting an Audience


Content Marketing lives or dies by its audience. If you can build a loyal audience, you’ve got it made. Otherwise, don’t quit your day job just yet.


Create content so amazing that your audience is willing to part with their personal information, time or money. The fact is you don’t own your audience, they can leave at any moment. However, if you remain relevant and helpful, often, your audience will reward you with loyalty.


I can hear it now. Doesn’t that just mean I need subscribers? What is this, a popularity contest? I thought I could just be me. You’re only half-way right.


Here’s the rub: subscribers who love your content are your bread and butter. But, why would anyone listen to your sob story if it doesn’t help them?


It sounds like a catch-22 but it’s not. Here’s what you should ask yourself: “Do I want to complain or do I want to help?”


If you can help me solve my problem then you’ve got my email, you’ve got my time and you’ve got my money. Andrew Davis says subscribers are a customer base before you even have a product.


Subscribers = sales.


However, not all subscribers are not created equal. Focus on leveraging reach and control. E-mail is the best, followed by print and finally, social media.


Reach and control. Focus on that.


Finally, make it easy for your audience to grow. Improve your SEO, use target keywords, create shareable content, create unique research, network like crazy and improve your copy.


The goal here is simple: create content that is easy to find, easy to read and completely unique. The result? Almost automatic increase in engagement.


#### V. Diversification


Diversification is a good thing. If you leverage different content marketing channels, you can increase your brand’s reputation and this might lead to new business opportunities.


One of the most effective strategies is to start with a blog, then a book and finally public speaking. This strategy has been employed many times over by successful entrepreneurs such as Tony Robbins, Marcus Sheridan, Ann Handley and, of course, Joe Pulizzi himself.


If it seems intimidating, you’re probably looking at it the wrong way. These are all just different forms of content. The point is not creative talent, it is being able to help.


Have you ever read “Elements of Style”? It is ridiculously boring. Can I live without it? No. Other examples? Dictionaries, encyclopedias, maps. Insanely boring, exceptionally useful. 


Your goal has not changed, just expand the options available to you. There are many paths to the top of the mountain.


A blog can be an effective way to show your expertise in today’s digital world. Anyone who’s interested in who you are, should quickly know what you’re about by reading your blog.


Similarly, a book solidifies your reputation and can lead to public speaking opportunities. They are also easy to publish and relatively easy to market with the right audience. Additionally, the content can come from your blog or be co-created. Plus, a professional ghostwriter can help you out if you need one.


A public speaking opportunity can be a gold-mine. Again, focus on being original and helpful. Have a unique angle and deliver a killer speech. Make it a regular thing and people will want to do business with you.


Print is yet another underutilized option. Even today, people still consider print to be important. If someone bothered to print it, it must be important right? Additionally, this could be yet another revenue source.


Think broadly but deeply. Podcasts, videos, apps, webinars, conferences; these are just some of the options available to you. Use them.


You can also consider purchasing a thriving platform that attracts your desired audience. Think outside the box. Who knows what you’ll find?


#### VI. Monetization


Here is where rubber meets the road. You need cash. Want to know the best part? Content marketing is stupid flexible.


Here are a few models you can try: affiliate sales, advertising, consulting and royalties to name a few.


These models can be utilized in conjunction with your original product or idea. Nothing is stopping you from having multiple streams of income. The more creative you can be, the better.


It’s no secret that most millionaires have multiple streams of income. They make money off of everything they touch.


In the ‘Millionaire Fastlane” MJ Demarco describes this as a producer vs consumer mentality. Most people are happy just using other people’s products for which they trade their time and money. Do the opposite. Use majority of your resources to create what you need.


Do not limit yourself just because of what you think is possible. Just go out there and create something helpful that other people will be willing to pay you for. Once you understand that, business becomes an issue of self-perception.


This is not woowoo. It’s basic accounting. Leverage what you have to get what you need. The options are limitless.

## How to Develop a Content Marketing Strategy

Now that we have some direction, let’s get right into it, shall we?


#### 1. Set Your Mission and Your Goals


Why does your business exist? What problems do you solve? Essentially, ask yourself, “How much money do I want to make?” and “How am I going to do it?”

Next, why are you employing a content marketing strategy? How does this compliment your business? How does your audience benefit?

Decide on why content marketing is important. Here are a few reasons to consider:
    • Improved revenue
    • Improved sales
    • More traffic
    • Influence and authority
    • SEO success
    • Reduced marketing costs
    • Improved social media engagement


####  2.  Measuring Your Progress


You need to measure your progress towards your goals otherwise you are going nowhere.


You can use goal-setting frameworks such as SMART(Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound)  and CLEAR(Collaborative, Limited, Emotional, Appreciable and Refinable) in order to measure your progress.


The CLEAR framework is designed to be more adaptable than the traditional SMART framework. Choose what works and focus on making progress towards your goal.


Additionally, you can use OKRs(Objective Key Results) instead of KPIs(Key Performance Indicators) depending on which works better for you.


OKRs are also designed to be a bit more flexible than KPIs. They work well with the CLEAR framework because of this.


Evaluate the relevance of your goals and quantify progress constantly. Focus on what you need to do but be adaptable.


#### 3. Know Your Audience


You need to understand your audience like the back of your hand. This is absolutely crucial. Your business lives or dies with your audience.


Create buyer personas using demographic data. You can use different analytics tools depending on your desired platform. With this data, you can then create accurate buyer personas.


These buyer personas, otherwise known as customer avatars, should include your buyer’s pain points, information sources, desires, goals and demographic data. It needs to be blindingly accurate. Otherwise you aren’t maximizing on solving their unique blend of problems.


Aside from analytics, you can also employ the empathy map as described by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur in “Business Model Generation”. Place yourself in their shoes and empathize with them. Understand who they are, who they are trying to be and, ultimately, how you can help.


The ‘Jobs to Be Done Framework’ is a simpler way to execute this strategy. Simply ask yourself, “When I ___ , that’s why I want ___ , so I can ___ .”


These are all just frameworks. Again, pick whatever works. However, keep in mind that the customer doesn’t need your product, they need their problem solved.


Remember, your audience does not consist solely of customers. Nonetheless, your content should should serve all members of your audience satisfactorily.


Why? Because your content marketing goals are representative of your beliefs. Your audience believes in the same things as you do, otherwise they would not bother giving you their time. Walk the talk. Create content that is designed to engage all members of your audience.


This is known as content mapping. It is producing content that is a reflection of the buyer’s journey as described by the sales funnel model. The sales funnel can be used as a framework to help you plan out your content for all members of your audience.


#### 4. Content Audit


Take a good look at the content you already have. There is a good chance that there is a lot of good content just waiting to be used.


Be open-minded and look across all your channels. Articles, videos, podcasts, books. Anything goes. Just take stock of where you are now and then you can plan the way forward.


There are multiple tools to help you such as Screaming Frog, Ahrefs and SEMRush’s Content Audit Tool. These tools can help you track necessary metrics that measure how your content is doing.


You need to keep track of SEO, backlinks, content shares and content gaps. You can also carry out competitor analysis using these tools.


First know where you are then you can get to where you want to go.


#### 5. Content Plan
 
 
A content plan is the tactical aspect of your content marketing strategy. It lays out the specific steps that you will take.


You know where you are and you know where you want to go. Now you just need to plan out your exact steps.


Decide what type of content you will publish - blog posts, podcasts, videos, ebooks, webinars etc. Choose a central pillar to build around and then use other supporting content types based on impact.


Find relevant topics - Use customer pain points and questions, google trends, content gaps. Remember, content marketing lives and dies by the audience so you need to produce the best content for them.


There are different techniques to develop your content. One of the more popular ones is the skyscraper technique. Depending on what content you have already, you can syndicate old content as well.


To help you, you can use topic generator tools such as SEMRush’s Topic Research Tool, BlogAbout, HubSpot’s Blog Ideas Generator, Feedly and BuzzSumo if you’re in a rut or you want to see what’s trending.


Now that you have some ideas, create a content calendar to keep track of your workflow. This will help you prioritize your actions and keep you on track to meeting your goals.


You should also decide what content management system you will use. There are a variety of options: WordPress, HubSpot CMS, Squarespace and Wix to name a few. They vary in complexity, utility and price. Experiment and choose one based on your needs.


You also want to decide on your social media strategy as well. What are you going to post, where are you going to post it and how often.


Social media is crucial. It serves two purposes at once: marketing and diversification. You can also use automation tools here as well to schedule your posts.


Now you know what to publish, when, where and how. All that’s left is to do it.

 
#### 6. Content Strategy

According to Kristina Halvorson, a content strategy is the “creation, publication, and governance of useful, usable content.” It’s your content marketing efforts driven by your content marketing strategy. It’s the actions behind the know-how.


Execute, execute, execute. Conceptualizing at this stage won’t help you much. Just get down to work and do it.


Keep to your strategy and work on improving it. Content marketing can take some time but it pays off.


Just focus on being the best. No race was ever won by aiming for no.2.
