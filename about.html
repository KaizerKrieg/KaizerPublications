           <h1>IRASHAI!!!</h1>

           <h2>Hi, I am Dennis Kuria.</h2>

           <p>I founded Kaizer Publications when I realized just how much entrepreneurs struggle to connect with their audiences. Many honest, innovative and talented entrepreneurs suffer because they lack a voice. Despite their best efforts, they are drowned out by the masses and their dreams never take flight.</p>

           <p>As an entrepreneur myself, I sought to contribute towards the never ending clash between faith and fear. The fact is, sometimes all you need are the right words.</p>

           <p>I am a very passionate man who loves what I do everyday. I find joy in the simplest of things. I could watch a sunset forever if only the world would sit still for a moment! I am always looking for the next adventure, the next challenge, the next problem that needs my attention. I live in the infinite now.</p>

           <p>I love writing. It gives form to my thoughts and passions. In the quiet recesses of my mind, the words spring forth like water from a fountain. I want to share this with those that I can. If only so that we can meet like words on a page and contribute to each other’s self-expression. In this way, the beautiful tapestry of the never ending saga of human lives ensues and insures that our parts have been played. So that even in our final moments, we are complete.</p>

           <p>Before all that, how about we share in this moment together?</p>

           <p>Send me an email at kaizerpublications@gmail.com and I’d be glad to get back to you.</p>

           <p>Swoosh!</p>
