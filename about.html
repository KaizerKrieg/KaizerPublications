           <h1>IRASHAI!!!</h1>

           <p>Our story’s real simple. We write. We create. </p>

           <p>What we write about, what we create, that’s not so simple.</p>

           <p>Words have always had a magical quality for us. From rap to the declaration of independence, it’s all just words on paper or on a beat. Yet, the impact!!</p>

           <p>Our conversations and our thoughts. Communication and connection. Abstraction and manifestation.</p>

           <p>When we take a moment to think about it, the power of words can be astonishing.</p>

           <p>That’s why we at Kaizer Publications believe in them so much. The right words can make the difference between all-out war and peace (Mrs, Miss, Missus or heck even Madam!)</p>

           <p>We believe in this so much, we do this everyday. Everyday we change our little corner of the internet, by extension the world and ultimately oursleves.</p>

           <p>If we can change the words we use to describe ourselves, our dreams, where we come from, where we are going and who we hope to become, we will have changed the script; the story will never be the same.</p>

           <p>Therefore, next time you want to doubt that you’re a star, mind your language!!</p>

           <p>Swoosh!</p>
