    <h1>On Practical Dreaming…</h1>

    <p>We all have dreams. The question is, are they practical?</p>

    <p>First, let’s begin with a definition of terms. What is a dream? A dream, insofar as I understand it, is a conscious or an unconscious desire that has not been manifested. Practicality is the ability to act out, in a reasonable manner, whatever you set out to do with a fair amount of repeatability and accuracy.</p>

    <p>With these definitions in mind, what is practical dreaming?</p>

    <p>Most would say that it is selecting those dreams that “make sense” and then following them passionately. I disagree. Vehemently. This understanding overemphasizes on the practicality aspect and completely ignores the dreaming part of the equation.</p>

    <p>In as much as we need to reasonable, don’t let that deter you from your goal. Practicality is subjective. So is reasonableness. It depends on the dreamer.</p>

    <p>We all know of people who have defied the odds and achieved feats beyond the comprehension of those who doubted them. From musicians to martial artists to scientists to authors. You name it. Every field of human competency has always been led by people who defied the logic of the day.</p>

    <p>And these are the ones we know of. Imagine if you could peer through the annals of history and see the individual lives of each and every individual. What you would see is people living on both sides of the spectrum. The infinite battle between faith and fear. It is a personal fight that each and everyone goes through; either worse for the wear or better for having been through it. It is the way we perceive it and act upon it that will determine whether or not we will overcome or succumb.</p>

    <p>The meaning we attach to the things we do will, ultimately, determine the manner in which we do them. If you believe that that extra bag of chips is harmless because you’re not an Olympiad, then, guess what? You’ll never become one! From the most minute detail to the fate of the worlds, it all rests on the meaning we ascribe to it.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you’ve had an experience where you’ve met with a craftsman or a waiter or simply someone who usually would be forgettable because of their ‘menial’ role. Yet, when they serve you like you’re the leader of the free world, it’s hard to stop yourself from turning red. You almost want to stop them. And then they tell you, “I’m only doing my job.” Where do you get this kind of selflessness!!</p>

    <p>It’s all in the meaning we put into it.</p>

    <p>Similarly, how important are your dreams to you? Are they a wish?</p>

    <p>“Hmm.. I’d like to do that someday.”</p>

    <p>Or are they a burning desire?</p>

    <p>“I’m going to do this even if it kills me!”</p>

    <p>Who do you think is going to succeed? Which one is more practical? Heck, who’s being reasonable?</p>  Which one is more practical? Heck, who’s being reasonable?</p>
