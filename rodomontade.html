    <h1>Rodomontade</h1>

    <p>Rodomontade: Boastful or inflated talk or behavior.</p>

    <p>Now before you even start. Just know, I love my doggystyle.</p>

    <p>I’ve got a gripe to pick! I’ve got something to say and I’ll be damned if I won’t say it.</p>

    <p>What is up with all this darn cowardice?</p>

    <p>We live in a society that praises virtues such as courage, selflessness, altruism and compassion. Yet, these virtues are supposed to be lived out in conformity. By following the will of the masses and society’s wisdom.</p>

    <p>You want to be considered brave? Be a soldier. You want to be considered altruistic? Join an NGO. Want to be selfless? Become a priest. Want to show compassion? Never speak up!</p>

    <p>When did these virtues become attached to such weak perspectives? Why do we need to be validated by an external authority to express ourselves. Why do we need permission to be courageous?</p>

    <p>That is a contradiction in terms.</p>

    <p>Courage is, out of necessity, disruptive. It is not meant to make those around you feel comfortable. Why? Because it makes them question themselves. It makes them wonder whether or not they have the same stuff, whether they are cut from the same cloth. If you’re one of these people, then my gripe is with you!</p>

    <p>You see, personally, I believe that no human is limited. We all have infinite potential. Yet we imagine that another person’s success or lack thereof should impact our self-image. Let me tell you now. You have nothing to prove to anyone. You are a child of the universe, just like everyone else. You have a right to be here!</p>

    <p>The things you think, the things you feel, they are all valid! If you feel oppressed, speak up! If you feel compassion, express it! You want to change the world? Go ahead and do it. You do not need anyone or anything to validate or otherwise instruct. You are enough.</p>

    <p>If people understood what a great thing it is to be human, perhaps we would be more inclined to respect ourselves. Perhaps we would give ourselves the liberty to follow through with all our dreams and desires. Perhaps we would irrevocably change this world for the better, instead of relying on people who not only lack the capacity but also who do not share in our vision.</p>

    <p>We are made of stardust! Ashes to ashes. Hence where we come from and where we are going is already cosmic in scale. Why should we then be afraid?</p>

    <p>On our side are the virtues of truth and justice! These virtues have built democracies and you shy away from your own power? You dare ignore the raging tempest within you that will not die? That is treason!  How dare you ignore your own soul in favor of the opinions of people who have no skin in the game. They will not deal with the consequences, but you will have to look yourself in the mirror everyday.
Who do you want to look back? A victor? Or a disgrace? Who rodomontades??</p>
