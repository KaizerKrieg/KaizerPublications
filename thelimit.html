    <h1>THE LIMIT!!!!</h1>

    <p>Somedays I sit down and I ask myself, “Where is the limit?” Just how far can one go?</p>

    <p>When you ask yourself this question, all sorts of answers come up. From, “I’m no good” to, “Hold my beer.” We all have that itch.</p>

    <p>“Is this all there is? Kind of anticlimactic don’t ya think? But wait. How about if you could do handstand pushups on a motorbike going down a ramp. Then catapult off the bike while simultaneously   jumping off a ramp into two rings of fire (one for the bike and one for you cause you’re special like that). Landing directly on the bike while mid-air, pirouetting for the clout, and then landing gracefully where X marks the spot. I don’t know about you but I would pay good money to see that. I probably could stick the landing too.</p>

    <p>As human beings we have an unlimited capacity to imagine and hence create. All the wonderful things you see around you were once nothing more than a figment of imagination. Yet, this was the seed for all sorts of great inventions. From fire to steamships to airplanes to space-rockets! Everyday, out capacity to bring forth our dreams to reality only expands.</p>

    <p>Whether you think you can or you can’t both ways you are right. What the mind of man can perceive and believe it can achieve. The mind is the limit.</p>

    <p>From philosophers to statesmen to industry leaders, they all say the same thing; believe and you will achieve. There is no limit. Alexander the Great asserted that there is nothing impossible to him who will try.</p>

    <p>If the great men and women of the past believed this, why not you?</p>

    <p>Why do we hang on to our petty excuses and trivial problems when the world is our oyster?</p>

    <p>FEAR</p>

    <p>We are afraid. We are afraid we will lose. We are afraid we will die. We are afraid we will be ridiculed. We are afraid.</p>

    <p>But if I was to ask you, “Show me this thing you fear so much.” The best you can come up with is a representation.</p>

    <p>At this juncture, I invite you to take a leap of faith. I sincerely doubt it is as bad as you imagine. Even if it is, you have the same equipment that every great figure before you had. A body, a mind and spirit!</p>

    <p>What else do you need?</p>

    <p>We come into this world kicking and screaming and wondering, “Hey, what’s the big idea?” Here’s your answer. The big idea is you. You are the whole point. Without each and everyone of us, this world would be changed forever. It might be hard to imagine but we all play a vital role in the ever unfolding saga of the cosmos. Regardless of how small you may imagine your role to be, when you become who you are meant to become, you unconsciously give others the strength to do so.</p>

    <p>Your dreams were given to you for a reason. Live them out. Blind with radiance, light the way and lead with purpose. SHINE!!</p>
