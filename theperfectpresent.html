    <h1>The Perfect Present</h1>

    <p>I remember it like it was yesterday. The smooth rocks beneath my feet as I clamoured and climbed. The soft mud in my hands from the multiple times I slipped over and fell. I had to get closer. The thundering rush of the waterfall beckoned me with each step. I was at Zania falls. I was in the moment.</p>

    <p>The day before, a friend of mine had called me and informed me that at Her Majesty’s command, I was to make an appearance at her place. No questions asked. She had a gift for me.</p>

    <p>“Er… Okay.” I said.</p>

    <p>“Bring shorts!” she replied.</p>

    <p>“Cause I’ve got trunks for legs huh?” I said. No reply.</p>

    <p>The next day, I sauntered over and before I knew it, we were hiking mountain trails like Sherpas. There were forests all round painting the scene green. Birds chirped and critters dashed around to the tune. The drone of city life forgotten. Just where was she taking me? It struck me that an axe-murderer could make a killing here.</p>

    <p>Slowly at first, I heard water rushing by. Curious. The further we went, the louder it became. I began to notice little trickling streams all around. They seemed to spring up from the ground. The verdant lush began to get wilder and brighter. The rush was deafening at this point. It hit me. We were at a waterfall.</p>

    <p>Almost breaking into a sprint, I held her hand and we dashed to the source. Dodging branches and vines, leaping over chasms and pits, balancing ourselves on perilous edges, we could not be stopped. Adventure was at our heels and discovery in our grasp.</p>

    <p>It broke into view. An 80 foot tall marvel. Nature untamed. Untameable. Marvellous. Momentously breath-taking. We jumped into the pool of water at the bottom and looking into her eyes I understood.</p>

    <p>The perfect present.</p>
